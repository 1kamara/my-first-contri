Utilizing your current skills and the desire to learn new ones, the aim of the Single Page Project is to create something challenging of your own choosing to add to the community gallery of single page projects. You can build anything such as a portfolio, a landing page, a fan page, a mini game (Pairs, Hangman, snake etc), a soundboard.


## The Rules
The rules are simple:
- The code you write must be your own. Using articles and resources to guide you is fine, but copy and pasting large chunks of code will not help imporve your skills.
- All your code **MUST** be written in a single HTML file **within** the submissions directory of this repo.
- You **cannot** utilize any external resources such as API's, Images, Libraries etc
- Push your boundaries, try something new or add a twist.

## The Submission Process:
> If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at [https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!
> 
> A cool resource to learn about the fork workflow can also be found here - [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the `Submissions` directory, create a **HTML** file using your Github username as the filename.
2. Using only this HTML file create your project! It can be as simple or as complex as you like. This file should contain all your HTML, CSS & JS
3. In the submissions section below, add the details of your submission, using the example as a guide.

## Submissions

- [PROJECT TITLE] - [GITHUB USERNAME]

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
